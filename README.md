#### To do list:

---

##### Basic functions:

* Crop
* Rotate
* Flip
* Bright
* Contrast
* Temperature
* Saturation
* Vignette

##### Aesthetic functions:

· **Moire**:

>A pattern old TV's used to show a lot
>when an image with lines gets small in
>screen.
>Don't know the algorithm, need research

· **Dithering**:

>Will use Floyd-Steinberg dithering.
>Using error difussion, and letting
>the user specify how many colors
>he/she wants, and what precision
>should the dithering have.

· **RGB Shift**:	

>Will separate the image in two copies
>like 3D films, but with:
>Red - Cian
>Violet - Cian
>Violet - Green
>Make a copie of the image, and move
>it within a given offset, paint one
>with in colorA and other with colorB

· **Recursive Image**:

>It will repeat the original image
>in smaller ones, one inside the
>other, creating a pseudo-loop

· **Negative**:

>It will invert the colors

· **Negative Glitch**:

>It will invert the colors but
>it will glitch the screen (like
>some parts would not be negative)
>Probably just 1/2, or 2/3 of screen

· **Cut Glitch**:

>It will choose a (probably random)
>y1 and y2, and move it (with an offset)
>to left or right (probably random too),
>repeating the last pixel

· **WinXP Glitch**:

>It will choose a (probably random)
>y1 and y2, or x1 and x2, and it will
>repeat the last pixel, like counter
>strike camera when glitchs off the map
>or Windows XP when a window left a trace

· **Chromatic Aberration**:

>This effect is made by low quality lenses
>Will simulate ir by shifting every channel
>(Red, Green, Blue).
>Make two copies of the image, leave copy1
>only with channel Red, and other only with
>channel Blue, and move it with the offset
>leaving the original (with the green values)
>intact.

· **Pixelate**:

>Just pixelates an image

· **Bad TV Signal**:

>It will create 'waves' by selecting and
>y value, and offsetting it by drawing the
>entire row with +1 or -1 offset, relative
>to the original image.
>Pixel loss by painting it to black

· **Stickers**:

>Adding images on top of the original
>or edited image, like PC's, w95 icons, etc.

· **Filters**:

>Normal filters, and things like 'moire'
>that converts the image to black and
>white and shows a distorted grid on top
>of the grey and black values.
